## First Thoughts ##

... I hate these sorts of things and my Java knowledge on drawing things is exceedingly out of date (9+ years).

## Thought Process ##

Well Java is probably the wrong tool, but what if I chose to use Java, how do I draw a triangle?  Graphics2D, erk!

So, what about Javascript/HTML?  https://jsfiddle.net/macloo/JLVva/ that's promising, but I need to zoom and drag and preferably write some unit tests.
