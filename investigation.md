## First Thoughts ##

... I hate these sorts of things and my Java knowledge on drawing things is exceedingly out of date (9+ years) and I've only done server side things for the last 6 years.  

But I'll give it a go, even though my hopes are not high on completing this one!

## Thought Process ##

Well Java is probably the wrong tool, but what if I chose to use Java, how do I draw a triangle?  Graphics2D, erk!

So, what about Javascript/HTML?  https://jsfiddle.net/macloo/JLVva/ that's promising, but I need to zoom and drag and preferably write some unit tests.

Ooo, SVGs and they can be zoomed + panned (http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/interactive-svg-components/pan-and-zoom-control), albeit using buttons, but then that's all I can find examples for in Javascript

### Unit Testing ###

So there's an excellent post here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/300855/javascript-unit-test-tools-for-tdd on various javascript testing frameworks.

There's also QUnit (https://qunitjs.com/) which has come up when searching for "unit testing javascript".

Will now just need to try a framework out and see if it works for what I want it to do.
